you can add as much test lines as you want following these steps: (following previous order)
1 - copy and add test case (any testCase from the following)(in the SpeedControltest file >> InputTestCases group )
2 - rename the test case (eg. TCx)
3 - add the runner (eg.  RUN_TEST_CASE(InputTestCases, TCx) )(to the TEST_GROUP_RUNNER(InputTestCases))
